**🌼 To the Bright Minds of [Kindergarten Name] 🌼**  

Hi everyone! 🌟 Just a quick note from a parent who’s been thinking about… *shadow monsters*. You know, the ones that hide under beds or whisper “what if?” in grown-up heads? Turns out, even big people sometimes mix up *real* danger (like tigers) with *paper tigers* (like stress).  

Our brains have a brilliant “alarm button” meant to keep us safe—*fear*. But sometimes it gets stuck, blaring like a smoke alarm long after the toast is saved. 🚨 The trick? **Curious courage**. When the mind spins wild stories (*“What if the sky falls?!”*), we can pause, breathe, and ask: *“Is this truly life-or-death… or just my inner storyteller rehearsing drama?”* Spoiler: It’s almost always the latter.  

Fun fact: Anger and fight-mode? They’re fear’s bodyguards—superhero costumes for survival! But when there’s no tiger (just a tangled shoelace or spilled juice), we can gently tell Fear: *“I see you. But I’ve got this.”* Describe the “enemy” aloud—*“Ah, it’s just me worrying about bedtime stories!”*—and poof! The monster shrinks to mouse-size. 🐭  

P.S. Even grown-ups forget sometimes. So if you ever see us frowning at a lost mitten? Whisper: *“Don’t fight the mitten, friend. It’s not a tiger.”* 😉  

Warmly,  
[A Parent Who’s Learning Too]
